## Agenda

We'll have an introduction to the [Kinoma](http://kinoma.com/) platform, and talk about plans for this semester's *Hack the Mic* series, as well as future D-Lab offerings and other resources for networked sensors and other IoT-ish fun.

### Talk - 4:10pm (sharp!)

Lizzie Prader is a developer evangelist in the Kinoma Group at Marvell Semiconductor. She will explain some of the programmer and user
friendly Internet of Things (IoT) platforms at Marvell suitable for quickly developing, configuring, and deploying large numbers of wireless computing nodes. The Kinoma platform is easily programmable using Javascript and optionally a visual block based programming language:

### Discussion - 5pm

This talk was organized by Javier Rosa (who will also be available at the session) He is an nth year Computer Science PhD student in
the TIER research group researching the use of sensors to perform impact assessments interventions in emerging regions. He has deployed
projects in Ethiopia on measuring cookstove usage, Kenya on measuring power usage (as part of a commercial microgrids venture), and
Nicaragua on measuring whole house and cooling device power consumption.

Addionally, other leaders of last semester's [Hacking Measurement](http://hackingmeasurement.berkeley.edu) class will be available to discuss further educational and community offerings around social and environmental measurment.
