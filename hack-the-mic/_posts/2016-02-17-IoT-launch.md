## Agenda

We'll have an introduction to the [Kinoma](http://kinoma.com/) platform, and
talk about plans for this semester's *Hack the Mic* series, as well as future
D-Lab offerings and other resources for networked sensors and other IoT-ish
fun.

### Talk - 4:10pm (sharp!)

Lizzie Prader is a developer evangelist in the Kinoma Group at Marvell
Semiconductor. She will explain some of the programmer and user friendly
Internet of Things (IoT) platforms at Marvell suitable for quickly developing,
configuring, and deploying large numbers of wireless computing nodes. The
Kinoma platform is easily programmable using Javascript and optionally a visual
block based programming language:

- [Getting started with the super-friendly Kinoma Create](http://kinoma.com/create/)

### Discussion - 5pm

This talk was organized by Javier Rosa (who will also be available at the
session) He is an nth year Computer Science PhD student in the [TIER research
group](http://tier.cs.berkeley.edu/drupal/) researching the use of sensors to
perform impact assessments interventions in emerging regions. He has deployed
projects in Ethiopia on measuring cookstove usage, Kenya on measuring power
usage (as part of a commercial microgrids venture), and Nicaragua on measuring
whole house and cooling device power consumption.

Additionally, other leaders of last semester's [Hacking
Measurement](http://hackingmeasurement.berkeley.edu) class will be available to
discuss further educational and community offerings around social and
environmental measurment.
