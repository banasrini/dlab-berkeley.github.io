## Agenda

We'll have an introduction to the [Kinoma](http://kinoma.com/) platform, and
talk about plans for this semester's *Hack the Mic* series, as well as future
D-Lab offerings and other resources for networked sensors and other IoT-ish
fun.

### Talk - 4:10pm (sharp!)


The Internet of Things is changing the way we interact with the
physical world. Using sensors to gather data is nothing new. But the
widespread act of connecting sensors to the cloud and other devices is
a relatively new enterprise that can benefit consumers, businesses,
healthcare, and municipalities.


This also creates opportunity for the developers that are able to
build connected sensor-driven devices. With the current hardware
revolution happening all around us, these opportunities are not just
the domain of experienced engineers.


The push for STEM in classrooms, the maker movement, and the growing
number of online learning resources is making it increasingly easier
to get into connected hardware development—as a hobby, as a way to
bring product ideas forward, and as a long-term profession.


During this talk you will learn about how you can dive into the world
of making and IoT with the Kinoma platform. Our products are designed
to help developers of all skill levels rapidly prototype connected
devices so everyone—not just trained engineers—can start making!

#### About Lizzie Prader

Lizzie graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Computer Science.
She now works with the Kinoma team as Developer Evangelist, and is
working on software engineering focused around the needs of
developers, and interacting with developers, makers, and customers to
help them get the most out of Kinoma.


#### About Kinoma

Developers, programmers, and designers rapidly create better connected
products with Kinoma's hardware and software. We foresee that
scripting will realize the potential of IoT, and have developed a
powerful and accessible set of solutions centered on this belief.
Kinoma’s open source application framework is uniquely designed to
build the core applications of embedded devices using JavaScript. And
Kinoma’s scriptable hardware kits make fluid exploration of ideas,
swift product development, and ramp up to mass production possible.


Kinoma is a tightly integrated design and engineering team within
semiconductor giant Marvell. Kinoma joined Marvell in 2010, bringing
the team’s proven heritage in software architected for high
performance on everything from phones and tablets, to the Internet of
Things. Marvell’s chips power everyday electronics, including Google
Chromecast, Samsung Tablets, and Lenovo Smart TVs.


### Discussion - 5pm

This talk was organized by Javier Rosa (who will also be available at the
session) He is an nth year Computer Science PhD student in the [TIER research
group](http://tier.cs.berkeley.edu/drupal/) researching the use of sensors to
perform impact assessments interventions in emerging regions. He has deployed
projects in Ethiopia on measuring cookstove usage, Kenya on measuring power
usage (as part of a commercial microgrids venture), and Nicaragua on measuring
whole house and cooling device power consumption.

Additionally, other leaders of last semester's [Hacking
Measurement](http://hackingmeasurement.berkeley.edu) class will be available to
discuss further educational and community offerings around social and
environmental measurment.
