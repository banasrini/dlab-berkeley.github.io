title: Building Realtime Data Visualizations with Open Source Tools

## *Tentative* Agenda

Live visualizations create a better user experience but charting and mapping
realtime data streams can be cumbersome.

Learn how to easily build realtime, live updating animated visualizations with
EON, an open source JavaScript framework that connects C3.js open source
charting library and Mapbox’s map widget to realtime streams of data allowing
developers to collect, detect, and publish data in realtime to live-updating
charts, maps and graphs. We’ll run through several code examples for building
live gauge charts, spline charts, map/tracking charts, bar charts, donut charts
and more.
