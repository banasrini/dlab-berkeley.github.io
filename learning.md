## From the Berkeley Campus

 - Jarrod Millman and Chris Paciorek have developed [some
   tutorials](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials).
 - The Python community on campus maintains a [list of
   resources](http://python.berkeley.edu/learning_resources.html).

## And beyond

Remember, you can ask the D-Lab to host a working group for any MOOC! We'll help
with space and publicity. All we need is a dedicated lead that will coordinate
the details.
